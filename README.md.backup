# Omarchy Calculator

A minimal opinionated calculator app for Omarchy.

## The backstory

While I was watching this Omarchy 2.0 update video, I heard that DHH didn't like the current calculator app bundled with Omarchy. So I thought I'd make one to the style of the distro.
In that same video, he mentions that he loves [Typora](https://typora.io/), a very minimal and focused text editor, so I chose to make this calculator similar in style while not missing too many features.
That same day I was scrolling on X when I saw this [post](https://x.com/aloisdeniel/status/1959979080331518079) by [Aloïs Deniel](https://x.com/aloisdeniel) and I saw the opportunity to make something useful and easy for the distro.

## The boring part

Most of the start of this app was vibe coded, but from now on I'm committing more time and effort to making sure it's quality and that I take it as a learning opportunity.
